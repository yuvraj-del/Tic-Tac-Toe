# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Java using IntelliJ and JavaFX for the user interface. The game supports both two-player mode and single-player modes with two difficulty levels: easy and impossible. The impossible difficulty uses the **miniMax algorithm** to create an unbeatable AI opponent.
